Lost the original VisualSVN repository, so bringing the code back here (albeit with no history)

# How to run

* Create a new database in SQL Server 2008 or higher
* Run the scripts under the SQL folder in order
* Create a new application in IIS
* Point that application to the /QScore/QScore folder
* Edit the connection string locally on `Web.config`
* Go to the address you created in your browser
